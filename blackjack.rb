# ============================================================================== Pseudocode Algorithm

# 1. Prepare the decks. Generate 52 unique cards. Repeat for cases with more than
#    1 deck. Shuffle all the cards.
# 2. Allow user to place bets, knowing that wins pay 1:1 and blackjack pays 2:1 
#    on one deck and 3:1 on more than one deck.
# 3. Deal 2 cards to each player. 
# 4. Allow player to either hit (be dealt another card) or stay (no more cards)
#    until all players are either "busted" or satisfied with their position. See
#    rules of card addition.
# 5. Dealer gets two cards and must hit until a total of at least 17. Dealer can
#    choose to stay or hit past 17, but aims for the highest hand without breaking
#    a total card sum of 21. 
# 6. When dealer is satisfied, any player with a smaller card total loses their
#    entire bet. Any player with equal sum neither loses nor gains ("push"). Any
#    player with a greater sum wins 1x more than their bet. Any player with 
#    blackjack wins 2x or 3x more than their bet depending on the number of decks.
# 7. Repeat steps 3 - 6 until the deck(s) is empty. At which time, repeat step 1.
# 8. Game is over when the player either has no more money to bet or walks away.

# Card addition rules
# - An ace is worth either 1 or 11, whichever gets closer to 21 without going over
# - Face cards (K, Q, J) are worth 10
# - All number cards are worth their number, regardless of suit
